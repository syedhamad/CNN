Image Clustering Using Convnets Transfer Learning and K-Means
Image Clustering using simple KMeans does'nt yield good results. Simply flattening the image and passing it to KMeans doesn't preseve image features. Instead, Convolutional Neural Networks preserves important characteristics of an image, as its biologically inspired by the architecture that is present in human/animal brains. Convolutional Neural Network layers detects pixels, edges, text, parts, objects in the image, thereby preserving all the important features of an image. Here we are trying to cluster the images based on
